add things onto the stack using push family
ex: pushq

copes the value to loc specified by %rsp
you can then pop off the stack
see factorialstack.s for ex prog

LOOSE COUPLING {

We dont want to mess with registers
we want it to be easy to add new things to the code
without modifying previous things}

We can reserve space on the stack
we do this by subtradcting from the stack pointer rsp
rsp is th
